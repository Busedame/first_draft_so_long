To do:

Fix consecutive newlines in the end of the map-file:
		--> Look into map_check_size.c, count_each_line-function.

Fix memory leaks -> Really look into where you allocate for the struct, and
the structs within the structs.

There are several bugs when opening different maps, like being able to exit
before all collectibles are collected, wrong start position, and some weird
stuff happening.

Make a Makefile.
